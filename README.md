PictShare Chrome extension
==========

This is the source code of the [PictShare](https://www.pictshare.net) image/screenshot uploading extension for Google Chrome.
I made it OpenSource since I wanted you to check that all the data is always tansmitted via https.

PictShare is a website where you can upload images which will be anonymized by removing all EXIF data like GPS locations, camera model or other info.
After uploading you'll get the link to a tracking site where you can see how many times your image was seen from how many people on the web and which websites have embedded it.
